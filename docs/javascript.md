# JavaScript

For JavaScript-based projects, follow the [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com) style (yes, without semi-colons). If you're writing code that won't be transpiled, you should fall back to [Semistandard](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard) (it's Standard + semicolons).

If writing code that will go through a build process, you can use ES6 features (just make sure you set up Babel). If not, limit yourself to ES5 for maximum browser compatibility.

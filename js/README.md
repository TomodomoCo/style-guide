# JavaScript

For JavaScript-based projects, follow the [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com) style (yes, without semi-colons).

For code that will not or can not be transpiled, fall back to [Semistandard](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard) (it's Standard + semicolons).

Use of ES6 features is encouraged if your code will be transpiled.

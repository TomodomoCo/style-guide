# JavaScript

For JavaScript-based projects, follow the [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com) style (yes, without semi-colons).

For code that will not or can not be transpiled, fall back to [Semistandard](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard) (it's Standard + semicolons).

Use of ES6 features is encouraged if your code will be transpiled.

## Modifications

We make the following additions and modifications to Standard:

+ Dangling commas are always required in multiline arrays, objects, and function calls.
